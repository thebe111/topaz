# CHALLENGE SOLUTION

### How to Run

for the best abstraction was implemented a `Makefile`, for all below commands
expected the user be inside the **virtual environment**

**install dependencies**

```shell
$ pip install dependencies.txt
```

**test**

```shell
# unit
$ make unit-tests

# integration
$ make integration-tests

# all
$ make tests
```

**script**

```shell
$ make run
```

### Used Technologies

- Python3+

### Observations

Because it's a simple script all abstractions was put inside the `main.py`
